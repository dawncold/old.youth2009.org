    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>merge sort的时间复杂度，log2n，曾经在算法书上看到过，相应的，merge sort也可以三分，复杂度变成log3n，好像还不错，但差多少呢？</p>

<p>log3n=log2n/log2(3)，也就是只差了1/log2(3)对于看起来还更大。一般算法复杂度是log2n表示就是这个原因，loga(n)和log2n差不了太多，都是常数级别的差距，而且在复杂度分析的时候都会忽略常数，所以就简记为log2n复杂度了：）</p>

<p>RARP packet is identical to ARP packet, differences: RARP &lsquo;type&rsquo; field is 0x8035 for request and reply and &lsquo;op&rsquo; field is 3 for RARP request and 4 for RARP reply.</p>

<p>RARP&rsquo;s reply is unicast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Conceptual Models</h2>

<p>Designing software so that its structure reflects that of the problem.</p>

<p>Analysis is not only listing requirments, but also looking behind the surface requirments to come up with a mental model of what is going in the problem.</p>

<p>Conceptual model is a human artifact.</p>

<p>Developers use conceptual models to represent a model of the real world in order to understanding the read part of problems easily.</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong model, merely one that is more useful for the job at hand.</p>

<p>The example, snooker simulation, if your choose a Einsteinian model would be flexible enought to low speed or high speed situation, but the complexity is totally different you know, so the flexibility and many others aspects need a trade-off.</p>

<p>When building a model in a programming language, maybe Python, you may get lost in this language or building this model using some features belong to Python, so this model is a Python-model, and it is hard to be implemented in other languages such as Java, PHP, etc. To avoid these problems, you need a third-party analysis techniques.</p>

<p>Only domain experts could build right model, because of their domain knowledge.</p>

<p>Conceptual model is closely to software interfaces rather than software implementations. One of the important things about OO is that it separates interface from implementation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP need IP datagrams as data transmitting method.</p>

<p>IP is a unrealiable and connectionless delivery service.</p>

<ul>
<li>unrealiable: no guarantee that an IP datagram successfully get to its destination.</li>
<li>connectionless: IP doesn&rsquo;t maintain any state of successive datagrams, it means there is no order in IP datagrams, latter sent IP datagram may arrived before former sent.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Header</h2>

<p>TOS: 3 bits precedence field(ignored today), 4 bits TOS(mini delay, max throughput, max relability, mini monetary cost), 1 bit always 0. TOS maynot supported by most TCP/IP implementations today, but some routing protocol such as OSPF and IS-IS are capable of making routing decisions based on this field.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a host isn&rsquo;t required to receive a datagram larger than 576 bytes. TCP and UDP will divide user data into small pieces, so one IP datagram will below that limit.</p>

<p>Some small IP datagram will be padded up to the mini length of frame, which maybe 46 or 38 bytes, so total length field is required when you want to know how long the IP datagram&rsquo;s length on earth.</p>

<p>TTL: set by sender, if this datagram pass a router, it will decrease 1, when it reaches 0, this datagram will thrown away, and sender will received an ICMP message. prevent routing loop.</p>

<p>Checksum: TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP use same algorithm to computing checksum. Since a router often cheages only TTL value, a router can incrementally update the checksum when it forwards a datagram, instead of calculating the checksum over the entire IP header again.</p>

<h2>IP routing</h2>

<p>The fundamental difference is that a host never forward a datagram from one of its interface to another, while a router forwards datagram.</p>

<p>Router may reach a local optimum result, because every search route table, the router will get a closer next-hop router address, but it may not global optimum.</p>

<p>Frame&rsquo;s destination address(MAC address) may not the really destination address, it may the next-hop router&rsquo;s MAC address, because when it is routing, it can&rsquo;t be found in the current network, it must be routed to a next-hop router, so the destination address is the next-hop router&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2>Subnet addressing</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget subtract 2, because all 0 bits and all 1 bits address for host address is invalid.</p>

<p>The advantage to using s single class B address with 30 subnets, compared to 30 class C addresses, is that subnetting reduces the size of the Internet&rsquo;s routing tables entry.</p>

<p>A special address: 127.x.x.x means loopback address, not only 127.0.0.1 can be loopback address!</p>
